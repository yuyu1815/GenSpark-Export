# Extension Icons

This directory should contain the following icon files:

- icon16.png (16x16 pixels)
- icon48.png (48x48 pixels)
- icon128.png (128x128 pixels)

These icons are used in various places in the Chrome browser UI:

- Extension management page
- Toolbar
- Chrome Web Store

## Creating Icons

You can create these icons using any image editing software like Photoshop, GIMP, or online tools.

For a quick solution, you can use a free online tool like:

- [Favicon.io](https://favicon.io/)
- [Icon Kitchen](https://icon.kitchen/)

## Placeholder Icons

For development purposes, you can use placeholder icons:

1. Create a simple colored square with the text "CSV" on it
2. Export in the required sizes (16x16, 48x48, 128x128)
3. Save as PNG files with the names listed above

## Icon Guidelines

- Use simple, recognizable imagery
- Make sure the icon is recognizable even at small sizes
- Use transparent backgrounds
- Follow Chrome's design guidelines
